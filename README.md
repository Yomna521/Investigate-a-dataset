### Introduction

TMDB (The Movie DataBase) is a dataset that contains data about movies. These data were collected from the community. Each movie has some interesting attributes such as:

    original title
    genres
    cast
    director
    release year
    budget
    revenue
    rating

To get an insight on the different data patterns, I'll try to breakdown the dataset and answer some question, such as:

    Which genres are most popular from year to year?
    Most popular actor from year to year?
    Did movies with higher vote count received a better rating?
    What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
    How did the number of film production changed over time?
